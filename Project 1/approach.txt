We were assigned with picking our own data structure to hold string entries that would accumulate over a long period of time. I decided to go with
an Rway trie. As far as storing strings goes, we know that tries are always the answer. I decided to choose the one that prefers speed over everything
else. Rway tries have a practically have a constant speed, outperforming the DLB in searching. The alphabet we are using is also not that large. We are
not accounting for all ASCII characters in this program, just all capital and lowercase along with an apostrophe. Space is the one area where Rway tries
can stumble, but modern phones using this algorithm are not going to complain over a few empty spaces in an array. This structure will last a long time
in the user's phone. Over time the empty spaces will become filled as the user enters more words.
